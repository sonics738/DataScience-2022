### Project objective
To wright the code, guessing the random number for minimum attempts.

**Requirements:**
- Computer is randomly selecting the number, between 0 and 100 and we need to wright the code to guess it.
- Code algorithm should consider whenever random number less or more of guessed number. 
- Code should use less than 20 attempts. 
- There is templates [*<ins>baseline<ins>*](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k2WZD8PWWOYFHrpAJoB2eZw06ID7KnFA) from screencast

**Quality metric**  
- Result would be evalueted based on average number of attempts out of 1000. 

**Our goals:**
- Learning to wright correct code in Python
- Learning to work with IDE
- Learning to work with GitHub
